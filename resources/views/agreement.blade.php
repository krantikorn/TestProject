        <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 1: STUDENT-INSTRUCTOR RELATIONSHIP</h1>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> I agree to maintain the ethics and codes of conduct established under the Terms of Service of
        United World Studios LLC.</p>
        <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 2: SERVICES</h1>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> <a href="#">Services Defined.</a> Under the terms of this Agreement, I agree to engage in online instruction
        services in the form of online conferences, Zoom sessions, telephone calls, in-person meetings, or any
        other form of communications deemed appropriate by Instructor (“Services”) in exchange for a Service
        Fee.</p>

        execute all of the lessons, assignments, and course work in the Service(s) to the best of my ability. I
        further agree to attend ALL scheduled Instruction sessions included as part of the Service(s). I also

        <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 8: LIMITED LIABILITY</h1>
        <p>Except as expressly provided in this Agreement or otherwise incorporated under the Terms of
        Service, the Instructor makes no guarantees, representations or warranties of any kind or nature, express
        or implied with respect to the Instruction services negotiated, agreed upon and rendered. In no event shall

        Student’s exclusive remedy, shall be limited to the amount actually paid by the Student to the Instructor
        under this Agreement for all Instruction services rendered through and including the termination date. As
        such, I agree that the Instructor is not and will not be liable or responsible for any actions or inaction, or

        circumstances.</p>
        <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 10: ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h1>
        <p>This Agreement and its duly signed addendum reflect the entire agreement between the Instructor
        and the Student, and reflects a complete understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter.
        This Agreement supersedes all prior written and oral representations. The Agreement may not be
        amended, altered or supplemented except in writing signed by both the Instructor and the Student.</p>
        <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 11: DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h1>
        <p><strong>A.</strong> <a href="#">  Dispute Resolution In General. </a> I understand that in case of a dispute between Parties relating
          to or arising out of this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute personally and in
          good faith. If these personal resolution attempts fail, the Parties shall then submit the dispute to binding
          arbitration. The arbitration shall be conducted in the county and state noted in the Governing Law
          provision of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator, and such arbitrator
          shall have no authority to add Parties, vary the provision of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or
          certify a class. The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing Federal law as well as the law of
          New York. Each Party shall pay their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating arbitration under this
          section include, but are not limited to: contract claims, tort claims, claims based on Federal and State law,
          local laws, ordinances, statutes or regulations. Intellectual property claims by the Instructor will not be
          subject to arbitration and may, as an exception to this subpart, be litigated. In agreement with this sub-part
          of this Agreement, I agree to waive any rights I may have to a jury trial in regard to arbitral claims.</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 11: DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h1>
          <p><strong>B.</strong> <a href="#">  Attorneys’Fees and Legal Expenses. </a> I understand that if any proceeding or action shall be
          brought to recover any amount under this Agreement, or for or on account of any breach of, or to enforce
          or interpret any of the terms, covenants, or conditions of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall <span>NOT</span>
          be entitled to recover from the other party, as part of the prevailing party's costs, reasonable attorneys'
          fees, the amount of which shall be fixed by the court, and shall <span>NOT</span> be made a part of any award or
          judgment rendered</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 12: SEVERABILITY</h1>
          <p>I understand that if any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable
          for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If the Court finds that
          any provisions of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would
          become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced
          as so limited.</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 13: WAIVER</h1>
          <p>I understand that the failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be
          construed as a waiver or limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict
          compliance with every provision of this Agreement.</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 14: GOVERNING LAW</h1>
          <p>I understand and agree that this Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with
          the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to any conflicts of law provisions.</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 15: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h1>
          <p>I understand and agree that all inventions, trade secrets, confidential and/or proprietary
          information, and work-product conceived, created or developed by each of the Parties, respectively, will
          be the sole and exclusive property of the Party to whom the information originally belonged. There shall
          be no transfer of intellectual property through this agreement. All copyrights, patents, trademarks, or other
          intellectual property shall stay with the original Party owner,</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">SECTION 16: INDEMNIFICATION</h1>
          <p>I understand that Instructor and Student shall each defend, indemnify, and hold the other harmless
          (including all affiliations, officers, directors, employees, agents, successors, and assigns) from and against
          all losses, damages, liabilities, deficiencies, actions, judgments, interest, awards, penalties, fines, costs, or
          expenses of whatever kind (including reasonable attorney’s fees) arising out of or resulting from bodily
          injury, death of any person, or damage, real or intangible, to personal property resulting from the other’s
