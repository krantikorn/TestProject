          community, art, cooking, language classes, and any class related services, content, features and products
          through the United World Studios mobile application (the “United World Studios App” or the “App”) and
          through United World Studios-controlled social media pages (collectively, the “United World Studios
          Service” or the “Service”). By registering an account with the Service or by visiting, browsing, or using
          the United World Studios Service in any way, you (as a “User”) accept these Terms of Service

          resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that (1) you may assert claims in small claims
          court if your claims qualify, so long as the matter remains in such court and advances only on an
          individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; and (2) you or United World Studios may seek equitable
          relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, trade
          dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and patents). This Arbitration Agreement shall apply,

          CLAIMS, YOU COULD BE AWARDED MONEY OR OTHER RELIEF BY AN ARBITRATOR.</p>

          <p>The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS under its rules and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.
          Disputes involving claims and counterclaims under $250,000, not inclusive of attorneys’ fees and interest,
          shall be subject to JAMS’s most current version of the Streamlined Arbitration Rules and procedures
          available at http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/; all other claims shall be subject to
          JAMS’s most current version of the Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at
          http://www.jamsadr.com/rules-comprehensive-arbitration/. JAMS’s rules are also available at

          filing, administration, and arbitration fees will be governed by JAMS’s rules. If the arbitrator finds that
          you cannot afford to pay JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees and cannot obtain a
          waiver of fees from JAMS, United World Studios will pay them for you. In addition, United World
          Studios will reimburse all such JAMS’s filing, administrative, hearing and/or other fees for claims with an
          amount in controversy totaling less than $10,000. If JAMS is not available to arbitrate, the parties will
          select an alternative arbitral forum. You may choose to have the arbitration conducted by telephone, video
          conference, based on written submissions, or in person in the country where you live or at another
          mutually agreed location.
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>Arbitrator Powers. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court or agency, shall have exclusive
          authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of
          this Arbitration Agreement including, but not limited to any claim that all or any part of this Arbitration
          Agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of you and
          United World Studios. The arbitration proceeding will not be consolidated with any other matters or
          joined with any other proceedings or parties. The arbitrator will have the authority to grant motions
          dispositive of all or part of any claim or dispute. The arbitrator will have the authority to award monetary
          damages and to grant any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual under applicable law,
          the arbitral forum’s rules, and this Agreement (including this Arbitration Agreement). The arbitrator will
          issue a written statement of decision describing the essential findings and conclusions on which any
          award (or decision not to render an award) is based, including the calculation of any damages awarded.
          The arbitrator shall follow the applicable law. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief on an
          individual basis that a judge in a court of law would have. The arbitrator’s decision is final and binding on
          you and United World Studios.
          </p>
          <p>Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND United World Studios WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND
          STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN COURT AND RECEIVE A JUDGE OR JURY TRIAL. You and
          United World Studios are instead electing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration, except as
          specified above. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is
          limited.
          </p>
          <p>Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions; Severability. YOU AND United World Studios AGREE TO
          WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO RESOLVE CLAIMS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION
          AGREEMENT ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ALL CLAIMS AND
          DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED
          ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE
          CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR
          CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver
          of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable with respect to a particular claim or
          dispute, neither you nor United World Studios is entitled to arbitration of such claim or dispute. Instead,
          all such claims and disputes will then be resolved in a court as set forth in Governing Law below, and all
          other provisions of this Arbitration Agreement shall remain in force. If any provision of this Arbitration
          Agreement is adjudged to be void or otherwise unenforceable, in whole or in part, the void or
          unenforceable provision shall be severed and such adjudication shall not affect the validity of the
          remainder of this Arbitration Agreement.</p>
          <p>Opt Out. You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement. If you do so, neither you nor United World
          Studios can force the other to arbitrate as a result of this Agreement. To opt out, you must notify United
          World Studios in writing no later than 30 days after first becoming subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
          Your notice must include your name and address, the email address you used to set up your United World
          Studios account (if you have one), and a CLEAR statement that you want to opt out of this Arbitration
          Agreement. You must send your opt-out notice to: unitedworldstudios@gmail.com. If you opt out of this
          Arbitration Agreement, all other parts of this Agreement will continue to apply to you. Opting out of this
          Arbitration Agreement has no effect on any other arbitration agreements that you may have entered into
          with us or may enter into in the United World Studios with us.
          </p>
          <p>Survival. This Arbitration Agreement will survive any termination of your relationship with United World
          Studios.</p>
          <p>Modification. Notwithstanding any provision in the Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if United
          World Studios makes any United World Studios material change to this Arbitration Agreement, it will not
          apply to any individual claim(s) that you had already provided notice of to United World Studios.</p>
          <h1 class="pdfheading">Governing Law</h1>
          <p>This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York, United States of America,
          without regard to principles of conflicts of law. The Uniform Commercial Code, the Uniform Computer
          Information Transaction Act, and the United Nations Convention of Controls for International Sale of

          hereunder will waive any further exercise of that right. United World Studios's rights and remedies
          hereunder are cumulative and not exclusive.</p>
